There are two separate files for each part named as binclass.py and binclassv2.py respectively

Command to run:
python binclass.py
python binclassv2.py

After execution of either parts, following will be output on terminal:
mu_minus
mu_plus
sigma_minus
sigma_plus

3 plots will be saved after executing part 1:
    quadratic1.png : For differnt variances
    linear1.png    : For same variances
    svm1.png       : SVM with linear kernel

3 plots will be saved after executing part 2:
    quadratic2.png : For differnt variances
    linear2.png    : For same variances
    svm2.png       : SVM with linear kernel

Both the programs have a commented line "plt.show()" at the last. Uncomment it to view graphs on execution.

SVM code is also included. Comment it if need be.
