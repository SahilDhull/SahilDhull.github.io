                  Adobe!
                  <br>
                  You might have heard this name at some point, be it for opening pdf or editing an image.
                  <br>
After securing my internship, I read a lot about Adobe, what it does, how it is performing. And boy, not only did I find something interesting, it was exciting too. Adobe is among top 10 workplaces in India (<a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/adobelife/2019/06/28/adobe-india-top-10/" target="_blank" class="button" style="color:blue">Check here</a>). With this excitement, I started my intership on 14th May 2019.
<br><br>
So this journey started in May'19, 14th of May to be exact. I took a flight from IGI Airport Delhi on 13th May, along with Samarth Agarwal, to Kempegowda Airport Bangalore. In the flight itself, we met Vikas Baghel (who later became my roommate for 3 months). We were received just like you see in movies... Driver standing with our names on a paper. Everything was going good, we breathed the air of Bangalore. But within few moments, my happiness turned into grief. My bag fell from above my suitcase, where I kept it and forgot about, causing laptop damage. On checking my laptop in the cab, I found out that the hinge was broken and screen was flickering. :(
<br><br>
Within 1.5 hrs, we reached the hotel where our stay was provided by Adobe. Apparently it was 5 star hotel (at least a claimed one :p). We were provided stay for first 15 days and breakfast was complimentary. On the first weekend, I went to a shop in the centre of Bangalore to get my laptop repaired. Cab took 1.5 hrs to travel nearly 20 km (yeah, Bangalore is huge if you don't know). And it took nearly 500 Rs. Whereas bus took only 60 Rs for the same distance. So please don't take auto or cab in Bangalore.
<br><br>
For the first 15 days, our daily schedule included waking up at 6:30 am, having breakfast, going to company premises by bus which left at 7:45 am. We reached the office at nearly 8:15 am. The office was as good as we imagined it to be. First class cubicles, Huge Adobe Logo at the entrance, pantry on each floor, 10 floor building, a nice cafeteria and a superb games room. We ate lunch in the company cafeteria, but had to struggle a little bit for the dinner. I still remember our local favourite dhaba, it was something by the name "North Indian Desi Dhaba". Mix Veg, Dal and Kulcha became our staple dinner for nearly 10 days.
<br><br>
The first day at Adobe was orientation, where we were introduced to various practices, trends at the office, work environment, work ethics and so on and so forth. After that we were given laptops and were assigned mentors and met our teams. My team consisted of Me, Samanway and Nikhila. And we were mentored by Niyati Chhaya (Senior Mentor) and Manoj Ghuhan (Junior Mentor). Our problem area was "Responsive Content".
<br>
From the next day on our schedule included waking up at 6:30, reaching office at 8:15, having coffee from cafeteria and moving towards cubicles for work. And yeah, playing was an integral part among other fun activities.
<br><br>
But before all this, let me explain <b>how research internships work at Adobe:</b> <br>
First your team is assigned a research area (which was "Responsive Content" for our team). Then within first 15 days, you have to bring atleast 80 ideas relating to that topic. After that comes the phase of clustering, where we clustered different ideas under different cluster names. Following this, we chose 1 or 2 clusters, and ideas from within those clusters to make 2-3 problem statements. After that you have to choose a single problem statement, give a 15 min presentation on your problem statement, efforts done so far and your future plan. Then you move towards solution phase, where first you have to give 3 different solutions to your problem statement. And then you start building your solution for next 1.5 months. And in the end, you need to build some demo and present your solution to everyone in a presentation followed by tech fair.
