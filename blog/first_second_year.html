                  <h4>First Semester</h4>
<p>
It all started exactly 4 years back with JEE Advanced 2016. It was characterized as one of the most difficult in the span of a few years. I messed it up a little bit, and got IIT Kharagpur CSE in the first round of JoSA Counselling. Me and my family were praying - “Hey god, please give me IIT Kanpur CSE”. And by god grace or whatever, that happened. So I was very happy that in spite of messing up, I got a good college and a good branch (‘good’ - as we defined at that time). So my journey started at IIT Kanpur on July 21st, just like everybody else. I explored some clubs - technical, sports and cultural, spent a lot of my time with my friends in “bulla” sessions (bulla - slang for long talk sessions), explored the recently gained freedom and the high speed internet.
</p>
<p>
Due to my interest, I took Tennis as my CPA (Compulsory Physical Activity) and this was the only time I played tennis on campus. First sem was a blast of fun, after 2 hectic years of studying. It was a break, that every one of us deserved. Except I took it too far. I didn't study even at the time of mis-sems or end-sems. All I could do was live my life in this freedom. After everything, my first sem SPI came (7.2). I started thinking - “Messing up has now become a habit of mine”. But academics apart, this was the first time I had a close to real world experience (read: I was on my own).

                  <h4>Second Semester</h4>
<p>
From this sem onwards, acads were also added on my radar. I swore to not mess up again. And it actually paid, the SPI came out to be good at the end of semester. Among technical clubs, Robotics and Aeromodelling caught my eye. But there was something else, something I didn’t know before coming here - Motorsports team (SAE IIT Kanpur). The automotive industry has always fascinated me, so I joined the team. Parallely I took an ACA project (like everyone else in CSE) on Cyber Security. There was not much work in the project - reason why I don't mention it in my resume. It was January 2017, and being from Hall-3, I had to participate in some event in Galaxy (Inter-hall cultural competition). Dance was my first choice. OMG! We practiced for more than 12 hours for around 10 days, before the competition. It was too tiring. And this was the first time I learnt about time management because of coping up with three different activities. Unfortunately, we lost the Galaxy. After that, I focussed on SAE and Acads throughout the semester. This semester's SPI was quite an improvement over the last semester's.

                  <h4>Summer'17</h4>
<p>
This time was crazy. Just before the summers, we went to Nainital for a trip. It was my first trip with my friends alone. I decided to do a course and remain active in SAE. And it was the first time when we'll be almost free from academics and still in campus, what better opportunity. Throughout the summer, we designed and fabricated the car - F18 (name give to it). I was in powertrain subsystem - associated with engine and drivetrain parts of the car. I learnt Solidworks and ANSYS as we designed parts in Solidworks and then tested them in ANSYS. I had a hands-on experience with many tools in mechanical engineering. I saw Waterjet machine, which cuts using ultra high speed water. And work apart, I enjoyed a lot. We played cards, 2k17 (WWE game), CS GO (I played it only rarely). We had a lot of "bulla", lot of masti, roamed around the campus in free time. All in all, it was superb.
